# Checking Out Sales Trends: A Simple Analysis

## What's This All About?
This project is all about looking at how sales change month by month. I wanted to see if there are good months and bad months, and what products sell the most. I used some simple computer code to help us find these things out.

## What I Wanted to Know
- How much money were made each month?
- How many orders was received each month?
- Which months were the best for sales?
- Which products are the most popular?
- What happens with sales on different days?

## Tools Used
- MySQL.
- A sales data table called online_sales.
- A file called Sales-Data.csv with the raw sales information.

## What I Did
1.	Made a Table: I created a table to hold all the sales data, like a digital spreadsheet.
2.	Loaded the Data: I put all the sales info into our table.
3.	Asked Questions with Code: I used SQL to ask questions about the data, like:
     - "Show me how much was sold each month."
     - "Which month had the highest sales?"
     - "What was the top 5 best-selling products?"
4.	Looked at Daily Trends: I also checked if some days were busier than others.

## Things I Found Out
- Sales change a lot from month to month.
- Some months are always better than others.
- A few products are super popular and make us a lot of money.
- I can see if sales are up or down each day.

## What I Learned
- How to use SQL to add up numbers (like sales) and count things (like orders).
- How to find the best and worst months for sales.
- How to see which products are the most popular.
- Basically, how to use data to make better business decisions!
