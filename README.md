# Checking Out Sales Trends: A Simple Analysis

## What's This All About?
This project is all about looking at how sales change month by month. I wanted to see if there are good months and bad months, and what products sell the most. I used some simple computer code to help us find these things out.

## What I Wanted to Know
•	How much money were made each month?
•	How many orders was received each month?
•	Which months were the best for sales?
•	Which products are the most popular?
•	What happens with sales on different days?
Stuff I Used
•	SQL: This is like a special language for talking to databases (big lists of information).
•	A sales data table called online_sales. It has info like when an order was made, how much it cost, and what was bought.
•	A file called Sales-Data.csv with the raw sales information.
What I Did
1.	Made a Table: I created a table to hold all the sales data, like a digital spreadsheet.
2.	Loaded the Data: I put all the sales info into our table.
3.	Asked Questions with Code: I used SQL to ask questions about the data, like:
o	"Show me how much was sold each month."
o	"Which month had the highest sales?"
o	"What was the top 5 best-selling products?"
4.	Looked at Daily Trends: I also checked if some days were busier than others.
Cool Things I Found Out
•	Sales change a lot from month to month.
•	Some months are always better than others.
•	A few products are super popular and make us a lot of money.
•	I can see if sales are up or down each day.
What I Learned
•	How to use SQL to add up numbers (like sales) and count things (like orders).
•	How to find the best and worst months for sales.
•	How to see which products are the most popular.
•	Basically, how to use data to make better business decisions!
What's in the Folder?
•	Result.sql – All the code I used to ask questions about the data.
•	Sales-Data.csv – The raw sales information.
•	README.md – This file you're reading right now!
